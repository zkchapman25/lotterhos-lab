## ImageJ & Mapping Oyster Shells
##### Co-authored by Zoe Chapman (Fall 2024 Co-op)
This tutorial provides instructions for running a qPCR plate, used to investigate disease prevalence of microparasites in the eastern oyster gill tissue.

##### **Equipment** {.unnumbered}

-   Standard stocks (from the company)

-   Disease positives (also from the company)

-   Extracted DNA - we are using eastern oyster (*C. virginica*) tissue in this protocol

-   Two rolls of different colored tapes

-   6 rows of PCR strip tubes

-   6 sets of PCR strip tube caps

-   1x 1.5ml DNA LoBind tube per plate

-   Strip tube rack

-   Multichannel pipette

-   Other pipettes (come back for specifics)

-   Pipette tips

-   1x TE Buffer

-   Molecular grade H2O

##### **Prepping the Hood** 
1. Tape off a section of the hood dedicated to parasite handling and label it 'Parasite' to reduce the risk of contamination

2. Place all of your work materials (pipettes, tips, etc.) in the hood to be sterilized

3. Turn on the UV light and fan at the top of the hood

4. Close the hood and let it sterilize for 20 minutes

##### **Preparing disease positives and standards** 
5. To rehydrate the disease positives, there must be 2.25ul total solution in the well at a 1:10 ratio (DNA : H2O) <- H2o or TE? WHich one did we do?

::: {.callout-note}
## Calculating the solution amounts for the disease positives
Put what we did here (2.25ul of 10ng/ul DNA, 20.25ul of H2O for MSX), (1ul of 10ng/ul DNA, 99ul of H2O for Dermo)
:::

6. Fill up an ice bucket or tray and place tube rack on top

7. Pipette into a thin falcon tube (or LoBind tube): 
  a. 600 ul master mix
  b. 360 ul molecular water
  c. 60 ul Dermo
  d. 60 ul MSX (positives i think)

8. Spin down the MSX tacman 20x Assay

## Contamination Awareness
Use filtered tips for every step of the protocol to aviod contamination
:::

9. Make the reaction mix using the Kollars method: 
  a. Pipette 133ul into A1-H1 (single channel) 
  b. Cap, vortex and spin 8 strip (A1-H1)
  c. Use the multichannel pipette to pipette 20.25 ul of the master mix strip tubes into each of the reaction mix strip tube wells (other 5 strip tubes) 
  d. Notes: change the single channel pipette tip every two wells, our 100 multichannel doesn't go to 2 decimal places so do 20.2 into each well

Other notes: 
- Replace each strip cap after pipetting into the column
- Use new tips every column
- Cover primers and probes with aluminum foil during any stopping points (light sensitive)

10. Pipette 2.25ul of DNA into each well from the plate (first 4 columns A-H, 5th column A-D) (image of plate plan here) 
  a. Note: Replace rubber caps of plate after pipetting each column to avoid contamination with anything in the hood

11. Use the single channel pipette to pipette 2.25ul of sample 36 into E5
  a. Note: Put DNA back in the freezer after pipetting into wells

12. Pipette 25ul of the Dermo parasite positive made at the begining into well F5

13. Pipette 25ul of the MSX parasite positive made at the beginning into well G5

14. Prepare the qPCR plate by transfering 10ul of each column into its two assigned columns (? reword to make clearer)
  1: into 1 and 2
  2: into 3 and 4
  3: into 5 and 6
  4: into 7 and 8
  5: into 9 and 10
  6: into 11 and 12
^ clarify this, not really sure what it is

15. Seal the qPCR plate with sealing film
